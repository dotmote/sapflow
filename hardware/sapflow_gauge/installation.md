# Sapflow Gauge Installation

See [here](https://bio-protocol.org/e2121) for Rob Skelton's excellent in-depth protocol.

## General Steps
1. Place the sapflow gauge onto the stem (<=1 cm in diameter) of a tree/plant.
2. Clamp the sapflow gauge onto the stem, ensuring full contact between the stem and each of the temperature sensors and heating element. Parafilm works quite well with enough windings.
3. Insulate the area around the sapflow gauge using styrofoam/bubblewrap.
4. Wrap the area around the sapflow gauge with reflective material, such as aluminum foil.
