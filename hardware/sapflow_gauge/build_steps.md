# Sapflow Gauge Build Steps

After you have your PCBs and [parts](./sapflow_gauge_parts.md), you'll need to assemble your gauges using the following steps:

1. Put solder paste on each of the exposed PCB pads.
2. Place each component on the PCB in their corresponding spots (i.e., on top of the solder-paste-topped pads).
3. Bake the PCB in a toaster oven (which you'll never use for food, as the fumes are hazardous).
